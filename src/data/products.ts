    description: `Ever wondered how platforms like Google Docs, Uber, or YouTube manage to feel so smooth, scale to millions of users, and never seem to break a sweat?

Welcome to the Frontend HLD Playbook â€” a deep-dive into the frontend high-level design of some of the most iconic and complex web platforms in the world.

This isnâ€™t just another theoretical system design guide. In this book, we break down real-world platforms like Uber, Airbnb, GitHub, Confluence, YouTube, Netflix, Instagram, Figma, and more â€” one by one â€” and decode how theyâ€™re architected, how they optimize for performance, and how they handle scale, caching, state, and user experience at a global level.

Whether you're a frontend engineer preparing for system design interviews, a curious learner, or a seasoned dev looking to draw inspiration from the best in the industry, this playbook will equip you with practical insights and patterns that go way beyond tutorials.

Letâ€™s peek behind the curtain and see what powers the frontend of the internetâ€™s biggest platforms ðŸš€`,
